I've been tracking neomoji inspired by Volpeon's neocat and neofox sets. I post
whenever I feel like it to summarize new ones that I've discovered at my own
discretion based on my own criteria. You can find them under the 
#NeomojiRoundup tag on Fediverse instances that can see the kitty.social
server. This is some of the code that helps me identify new neomoji with some
sanitation performed to preserve privacy and avoid licensing/copyright issues.
